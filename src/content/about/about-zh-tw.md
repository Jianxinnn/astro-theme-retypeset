I'm Jianxin, a second-year PhD student at East China Normal University.

My research area is AI4S (Artificial Intelligence for Science), specifically focusing on protein design and engineering. In addition to this, I also maintain a strong interest in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and explore ways to integrate it with my research.

In my leisure time, I am an avid supporter of Liverpool Football Club, often cheering them on passionately. I also enjoy unwinding with CS, LOL, although my gaming skills might need some improvement.
